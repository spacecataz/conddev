# conddev
Big updates to the conductance portion of the Ridley Serial model.

Different source folders contain code related to different updates:
Base code is found the `src` directory. Simply softlink these files to an SWMF install and continue development.

Code for adding conductance as a new file is found in `srcFileIn`.

Code that has been brought into sync with the main IE/Ridley_serial repository
should be moved to `src_complete`.
