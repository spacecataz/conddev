How to run MAGNIT using electron pressure:

1: Use most recent version from git repo (this is not updated to have electron pressure coupling yet)

2: Run Config.pl -o=GM:e=MhdPe or Config.pl -o=GM:e=MhdHypPe
   So far, code has only been tested with MhdHypPe... Whether or not it makes a large difference (or any) is not yet known

3: Use PARAM in this folder. Extra lines for electron fluid values are added in the GM and IM sections: #MINIMUMPRESSURE and #COMPOSITION respectively.
   Currently, the electron minimum pressure is set to be the same as for ions, this may not be the best value.

   NOTE: If writing a separate param, ensure #TRACEIE is turned on, as it is required for MAGNIT. This should be turned on by default for MAGNIT
   	 in the future.
   
4: Currently, there is a bug that causes a crash almost immediately after the beginning of the real time part of a run. For an unknown reason,
   this bug does not happen if the SWMF is first compiled with debug flags on, then debug flags are turned off and the SWMF is recompiled
   ***WITHOUT RUNNING MAKE CLEAN***. Hopefully this issue will be resolved soon, but as of now it is currently necessary to successfully run
   MAGNIT with electron pressure coupling. 

Notes:
1. Currently, MAGNIT uses a minimum electron pressure equivalent to the minimum ion pressure (1E-13 Pa), this may not be the best value.

2. Currently, electron density is *not* being flipped across the noon-midnight plane. This is consistent with the expected quasi-neutrality of the
   magnetospheric plasma, but not with the opposite directionality of motion from gradient and curvature drift. Which method is correct is not
   currently known.
